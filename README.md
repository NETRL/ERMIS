# ERMIS – AdvancemEnts in 3D IndooR Positioning Methods and ApplicatIons for Next-Gen Communication Systems

**ERMIS** is a 24-month research initiative aiming to push the boundaries of 3D indoor positioning using state-of-the-art wireless technologies and AI-driven methods. The project integrates **Machine Learning**, **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)**, **mmWave radar sensing**, and **IEEE 802.11az-based Fine Time Measurement (FTM)** to achieve sub-meter positioning accuracy in complex environments.

The project develops and validates techniques in lab settings and demonstrates their applicability to use cases such as **jamming attack localization**, **beam management**, and **emergency response localization**. A key output is an open-source **Positioning Toolbox** and curated **open datasets** for the research community.
